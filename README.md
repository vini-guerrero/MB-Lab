# MB-Lab

MB-Lab is a community developed and supported project based off ManuelBastioniLAB.

## Blender 2.8 Support

MB-Lab has been ported to work with Blender 2.80 BETA.

## Contributors wanted! Python programmers needed!

We are a small bunch of developers and artists but we always need more! MB-Lab's code is quite complex and needs work, to either fix bugs or to add new features, Python programmers are always welcome! Do you have other skills? We need modelers to help with future base models for instance. Are you a specialist in rigging? We could use some help improving the rigs for MB-Lab. There are lots to do in this project, we can only do so much at a time so please feel free to join us, fork the repository and then make something cool.

## About

Manuel Bastioni was active in open source projects since 1999.

Member of Blender Artist community since 2002.

He was one of the authors of "The Official Blender 2.3 guide, the open 3D creation suite", writing the chapter "From Blender to YafRay Using YableX"

In 2000 he started Makehuman Project, a free and open source software for the modelling of 3d photo-realistic characters, winner of "Suzanne Award" as the best python script for Blender 3D in 2004. He left the MakeHuman project in 2016.

He is the author of Manuel Bastioni Laboratory, a free and open source add-on for Blender to create 3d humanoids. It includes the results of years of prototyping and studies realized by him during the development of his 3d graphics projects.

This fork is an attempt to keep this addon going forward as the original author is no longer developing ManuelBastioniLAB
