LICENSE OF MODELS GENERATED BY THE SOFTWARE.
============================================

The AGPL can be an obstacle in case someone wants to create a closed
source game or closed source 3D models using 3D characters made with
the lab because the AGPL will propagate from the base models and from
the database to the output models.

For this reason it was decided to consent a double license ONLY for
the models generated by the official software*, NOT for the source code,
NOT for the json database and NOT for blend files included in
the distribution:

- The default license for models generated by the software
  is AGPL 3: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html.
  As derived product of the AGPL'd database, the models must be
  distribuited under AGPL 3, with the same copyright of the database.

- Alternatively, for closed source games or closed source 3D models,
  it's possible to choose, for characters generated by the official* software,
  the Attribution 4.0 International, giving to Manuel Bastioni the credit
  as required by that license: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode.


* Official software = officially released on www.manuelbastioni.com.

LICENSE OF RENDERS GENERATED BY THE SOFTWARE.
============================================

Rendered two-dimensional images or two-dimensional videos of a scene that includes 3D models generated
with ManuelbastioniLAB are not considered a derived product of the licensed 3D database and 3D base models.
Assuming that the rendering depicts a non-reverse-engineering scene[*], due to many factors
(i.e. the transformation from 3D space to 2D space, the position and the type of camera used,
the other 3D elements included in the scene, the position and type of lights, the post production,
the composition of multiple characters, the path of the camera, ecc.) the original 3D data is
fundamentally modified and transformed sufficiently that it constitutes an original work.

For this reason, the author of the 2D rendering is the sole copyright owner of 2D image/video
created by him and the sole responsible for the use of his 2D image/video.

Also the author of the 2D rendering can use any license for the two-dimensional image/video
created by him and of course he can use his two-dimensional image/video for commercial projects.

[*] For example, an orthographic rendering of a shadeless plane with lab textures on it,
will be considered as reverse engineering scene for textures extraction.
