LICENSE OF MODELS GENERATED BY THE SOFTWARE.
============================================

.. image:: images/agpl_logo.png

The AGPL can be an obstacle in case someone wants to create a closed source game or closed source 3D models using 3D characters made with the lab because the AGPL will propagate from the base models and from the database to the output models.

For this reason it was decided to consent a double license ONLY for the models generated by the official software*, NOT for the source code, NOT for the json database and NOT for blend files included in the distribution:

The default license for models generated by the software is AGPL 3: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl.html. As derived product of the AGPL'd database, the models must be distributed under AGPL 3, with the same copyright of the database.

 *Official Software was described as downloaded from www.manuelbastioni.com, but is no longer available at this URL

=======================
NOTE ABOUT 2D RENDERING
=======================

Rendered two-dimensional images or two-dimensional videos of a scene that includes 3D models generated with MB-Lab are not considered a derived product of the licensed 3D database and 3D base models.

Assuming that the rendering depicts a non-reverse-engineering scene[*], due to many factors (i.e. the transformation from 3D space to 2D space, the position and the type of camera used, the other 3D elements included in the scene, the position and type of lights, the post production, the composition of multiple characters, the path of the camera, ecc.) the original 3D data is fundamentally modified and transformed sufficiently that it constitutes an original work.

For this reason, the author of the 2D rendering is the sole copyright owner of 2D image/video created by him and the sole responsible for the use of his 2D image/video.
