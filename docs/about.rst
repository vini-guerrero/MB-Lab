MB-Lab was forked from ManuelBastioniLAB in November of 2018, shortly after Manuel Bastioni ceased development of his addon.
As it is open source, it was placed on GitHub with an invite to others to help develop and support this amazing tool.
What began as a test to see if things could be changed here or there has turned into a global project with several sub forks of it's own.

This document is a sub project in itself, it is a WIP and will continue to be developed over time.
