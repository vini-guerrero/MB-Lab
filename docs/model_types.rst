Model Types
===========


A "type" defines in one shot all the main features of the body: bone structure, fat percentage, mass and muscles. Each type is created upon anthropometric data and artistic observations and delineates the body of the character.

Types are labeled using simple names, like "ideal fashion", "athletic", "lazy", "hourglass".

The system uses this kind of identifiers because they are less difficult to remember and more intuitive than scientific terms utilized in anthropometry.

Types can be selected via the intuitive GUI in the main panel, it's also possible to use the "Mix" option to blend different types.

A "special-type" differs from the "type" because it can describe non-realistic creatures (as example comic heroes, brute and other people with augmented proportions) or data-only entities (for example "older" and "younger" special types).

Depending on the features that are modified and the way they are modified, types can be grouped in some big categories:

* Types defined mainly by the variation of muscle and mass percentages
* Types defined mainly by the variation of proportions
* Types defined by basic shapes
